# Realtime-DB-Recovery-System
Application to recover a dynamic dynamodb table without losing newly added data in realtime. This application allows you pick two points in time from which you want to undo the records added/deleted in order to recover a table from a ddos spam attack or an accidental deletion of data.

Next steps are to integrate anomaly detection functionality to intelligently figure out if a spam attack has occurred.
